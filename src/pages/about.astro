            <p>
              Salt Life Detail started from a simple frustration: finding reliable information about marine detailing products that actually work in Southwest Florida's harsh conditions.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              As jetski owners in Estero, we quickly learned that not all marine products are created equal. The intense UV rays, constant saltwater exposure, and high humidity create unique challenges that many products simply can't handle.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              After years of trial and error‚Äîand spending too much money on products that didn't deliver‚Äîwe decided to share our real-world testing results with fellow boat owners.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Every product we review undergoes months of testing in actual saltwater conditions. We use these products on our own vessels, in our own marina, dealing with the same challenges you face.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Our mission is simple: provide honest, detailed reviews that help you make informed decisions about marine detailing products and techniques.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              No sugar-coating, no affiliate-driven recommendations. Just straightforward advice from people who understand what it's like to maintain a boat in Florida.
