        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 mb-6">What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Affiliate links are special tracking links that allow us to earn a small commission when you purchase products through our recommendations. This commission comes from the retailer at no additional cost to you.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 mb-6">Our Affiliate Partners</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Salt Life Detail participates in affiliate programs with various marine retailers and product manufacturers. We carefully select partners based on product quality, customer service, and alignment with our values of supporting the marine community.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 mb-6">Our Review Philosophy</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
          <strong>Editorial independence is our foundation.</strong> We purchase and test products with our own money before writing reviews. Our affiliate relationships never influence our honest assessments.
        </p>
        
        <div class="bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 p-6 mb-8">
          <h3 class="font-medium text-gray-900 mb-3">Our Commitment to You:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-sm">
            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-green-600 mr-2 mt-1">✓</span>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 mb-6">How We Test Products</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Every product we review undergoes our standard testing process:</p>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Purchase:</strong> We buy products with our own money (no free samples)</li>
          <li><strong>Testing:</strong> 2-6 months of real-world use in Southwest Florida conditions</li>
          <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Photo and performance tracking throughout testing</li>
          <li><strong>Review:</strong> Honest assessment including pros, cons, and recommendations</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 mb-6">Revenue and Funding</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Affiliate commissions help fund our product testing and website operations. We also generate revenue through:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Product affiliate commissions (typically 3-8% of sale price)</li>
          <li>Local service referrals (when appropriate)</li>
          <li>Display advertising (minimal and relevant to marine detailing)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 mb-6">Identification of Affiliate Content</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">We clearly identify affiliate content through:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Link Labels:</strong> "Buy Now" buttons include affiliate relationship disclosure</li>
          <li><strong>Page Disclosures:</strong> Clear statements on product review pages</li>
          <li><strong>Attribute Tags:</strong> Proper rel="sponsored" and rel="nofollow" attributes</li>
          <li><strong>Visual Indicators:</strong> Consistent disclosure formatting across the site</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 mb-6">Price Transparency</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Affiliate links do not affect the price you pay. Retailers pay commissions from their marketing budgets, not by increasing prices for customers using affiliate links.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 mb-6">Local Business Relationships</h2>
